# Projects

## HW #3: Generation w/ Computer Vision

### Modifications

Fixed the page layout to center the image and ensure that the caption wasn't cut off and that the image didn't go over the caption. Also added a transitioning linear gradient background as the background of the page.

## HW #2: Bored Button

### Modifications

Restyled the page layount and imported the Bulma CSS library. Used styles to animate the bored button, incorporated icons from FontAwesome, and created a card that dynamically stored new information from the Bored API.

## HW #1: Personal Portfolio

### Modification #1: Title

Added TypeWriter effect to the role section of the title, and implemented animate library to add bounce animations to the title. Also fixed links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and to the resume, and added an icon to the resume button.

### Modification #2: Projects

Added images to each of the project cards, and added relevant information about 3 of my CS projects to each of the cards. Fixed GitHub links for each project, and added hover/cursor effects for the tags underneath the projects.

### Modification #3: Skills

Added a new section for a detailed description of each of my skills (so far the descriptions are basic, but will work on fleshing those out in the future). Also used JavaScript to create buttons on the original skills that toggle through different information about the section. Finally, added an icon to the contact me button, and fixed it to send to the right email.
